# Tripti-GDSC-Solution-Challeneg-2021
No One shall sleep hungry...

We aim to provide food to the needy ones as well as to end the wastage of food that takes place in 
nearly every household with brutal ignorance. Our idea is to collect the food, that would have been 
otherwise wasted, at some “Food Points” (That will be created in required localities depending upon 
the needs) and make it available to children, men, women who come to those distribution points
to recieve a meal.

Fresh food that would have been wasted goes to people and leftover food (but still edible) goes to animals.
